<h1>Tuition Fruition</h1>
<p class="intro-paragraph"> &nbsp Welcome to my online  store <strong>Tuition Fruition</strong>. I like to pride myself on not only selling one of a kind gear, but also <br>
  helping you clutter your room with things you don't really need. This website is somewhat of an online Deseret<br>
  Industries except these items are high on sentimental value and low on usefullness. Whether you are looking for<br>
  school supplies, food or even items to make your party the next big thing, we have it all here. Also, as a side<br>
  benefit of this amazing store, many of the items will never go away unless you buy them (but seriously, they will<br>
  be around for months). So don't feel bad for not buying that special deal that  you see going on, it will be there<br>
  tomorrow. We hope you have a great experience and happy shopping!</p>
